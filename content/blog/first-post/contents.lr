This is an example blog post.  Not much here but that's not the point :)

```python
async def hello(name: str = 'world') -> str:
    """Greet $username."""  # docstring + comment
    a, b = 3, '4'
    await a
    async with a:
        del b
    "ssss"
    1_00_110
    some_var: int
    return name
```
